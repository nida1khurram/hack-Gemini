# Physical AI Robotics Hackathon Project

This project was developed as part of a hackathon, focusing on Physical AI Robotics. The goal was to explore and implement AI solutions for controlling and interacting with physical robotic systems.

## Project Description

The "Physical AI Robotics" project aims to bridge the gap between theoretical AI concepts and their practical application in robotics. During the hackathon, we focused on:

*   **AI-powered control:** Developing intelligent algorithms for robot navigation, manipulation, and decision-making.
*   **Sensor integration:** Utilizing various sensors to enable robots to perceive and understand their environment.
*   **Human-robot interaction:** Designing intuitive interfaces for humans to interact with and command robotic systems.
*   **Learning and adaptation:** Implementing machine learning techniques to allow robots to learn from experience and adapt to new situations.

## Technologies Used

This project leveraged a combination of technologies for both the AI and robotics aspects. (Further details would be added here based on specific technologies used during the hackathon, e.g., Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, ROS, specific robot platforms, etc.)

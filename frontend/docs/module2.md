title: "Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)"
---

This module introduces the concept of a Digital Twin, a virtual representation of a physical object or system. We will explore two of the most powerful simulation platforms in robotics: Gazebo and Unity.

**Key Learning Areas:**
- **Simulation Fundamentals:** Understand why simulation is critical for robotics development, testing, and validation.
- **Gazebo:** Learn to build and simulate robot models, worlds, and sensors in Gazebo, a robust and widely-used robotics simulator.
- **Unity:** Discover how to leverage the Unity engine for high-fidelity rendering, physics simulation, and creating interactive robotic environments, particularly for tasks involving machine learning and vision.
- **ROS Integration:** Integrate your simulations with ROS 2 to create a seamless workflow between your simulated robot and its control software.

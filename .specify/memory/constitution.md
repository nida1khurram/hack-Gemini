# AI-Native Textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### Academic Rigor with Industry Relevance
All technical concepts must be traceable to official documentation or peer-reviewed sources. Citation format: APA style for academic references. Source types: Mix of peer-reviewed papers, official documentation (ROS 2, NVIDIA), and industry best practices.

### Hands-On, Project-Based Learning
Code examples: Must be executable with clear setup instructions. Minimum 50 code examples with working implementations. Must include assessment questions and project ideas for each module.

### Accessibility and Clarity
Accessibility across skill levels (beginners to advanced). Language clarity: Flesch-Kincaid grade 12-14 (university level). Visual content: Include diagrams, screenshots, and simulation visualizations.

### Verifiable Claims
All claims about hardware performance must be verified with manufacturer specifications.

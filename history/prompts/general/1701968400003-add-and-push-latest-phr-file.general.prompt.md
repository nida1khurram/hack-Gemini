## Prompt
```text
yes
```

## Response
```text
The PHR file has been successfully committed and pushed to GitHub.

Now, I will create a PHR for this interaction.
The interaction involved:
- User confirming to add and commit the PHR file.
- Staging, committing, and pushing the PHR file.

This falls under a "general" stage.
The title will be "Add and push latest PHR file".
The files modified/created are:
- `history/prompts/general/1701968400002-push-pending-commits-to-github-ci.yml-fix-and-docusaurus-config-update.general.prompt.md`

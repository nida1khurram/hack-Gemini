## Response snapshot

I have created the feature specification for the "AI-Native Textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics".
The specification is located at `specs/001-physical-ai-textbook/spec.md`.
I have also created a quality checklist at `specs/001-physical-ai-textbook/checklists/requirements.md`.
The project is ready for the next phase (`/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`).

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created the feature specification and quality checklist.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 2 files created
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`.
- 🧠 Reflection: The process of creating the specification and checklist was smooth.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The initial script to create the feature failed, but I was able to recover by creating the files manually.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment: None
